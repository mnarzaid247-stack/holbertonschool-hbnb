## Notes (Responsibilities)
- Presentation Layer (Services, API)

This layer handles interaction with the outside world.
It receives client requests through API endpoints and controllers, processes request/response formatting, and forwards actions to the system through the facade.
It does not contain business rules.

- Business Logic Layer (Models)

This layer contains the core logic of the application.
It defines the main domain entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity) and enforces validation and business rules.
The HBnBFacade acts as a unified interface used by the Presentation Layer to access the system’s functionality.
This layer determines what operations must occur and communicates with the persistence layer to store or retrieve data.

- Persistence Layer

This layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval.
It uses repositories or data access objects (DAO) to interact with the database.
The persistence layer hides database implementation details from the business logic.


## Data Flow

Client -> Presentation Layer -> HBnBFacade -> Business Logic Layer -> Persistence Layer -> back to Client
